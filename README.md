# Remove All Restrictions from School iPad
*Get the App Store back!*

1. Settings -> General -> Reset -> Erase All Content and Settings. Follow the instructions. 
2. Wait for it to get to the Hello screen.
3. Set up the iPad as fast as humanly possible. 
4. Turn off WiFi as soon as you get to the home screen *through the Control Center by swiping down from the top-right corner of the screen*. The icon for WiFi in the Control Center should be *white*. By this point, you should still have the App Store.
5. Settings -> Wi-Fi -> the (i) next to your network (*be sure you are NOT connected to it*) -> Configure Proxy -> Automatic -> type "https://proxyblocker.github.io/proxy.pac" (without the quotes) -> Save
6. Turn back on WiFi in Control Center the same way you turned it off. The iPad will reconnect to your network. 
7. Enjoy! 

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** You must perform the same steps on *all other networks* you connect to, otherwise you will go back to a normal school iPad within about three seconds.

## FAQ
#### Can the school district just block resetting iPads?
Yes. We have a workaround.

#### Will I get in trouble for doing this?
Maybe? Hide your non-school-approved apps in the second page of a folder. You can always remove the proxy thing to let it turn back into a normal school iPad (but make sure to delete all your App Store apps first so that it won't get locked).

#### Can the school see from their end if you have done this?
It's possible. We're working on ways to make the school's MDM server think that the iPad has been registered without it actually having done so. 

## FAQ for Teachers and Administrators
#### Students are goofing off in class a lot more now! How can we stop them?
You really can't. For your information, students have been messing around in class on their iPads for years without the App Store. Walking around the classroom, providing activities that require engagement, and creating more engaging lessons can help. Anyway, we've (almost) all got smartphones too. 

#### Can I do this with my iPad?
Sure, follow the instructions above. 

#### Is there anything that we can do to prevent this further?
Not by technical means. Blocking Erase All Content and Settings won't work (although we'll let you figure out why), requests to JAMF and Airwatch can be spoofed (even without a jailbreak), and restrictions cannot be applied before activation. 

#### Whodunnit?
A talented group of seniors at a public high school in upstate New York came up with the general process. It was shared through a Discord server (alledgedly) to members of a group in California, who posted it on Instagram. This site is a modified version of that Instagram post, tested and confirmed to work on another district's iPads.
