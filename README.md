# Remove All Restrictions from School iPad
##### Get the App Store back!

1. Settings -> General -> Reset -> Erase All Content and Settings. Follow the instructions. 
2. Wait for it to get to the Hello screen.
3. Set up the iPad as fast as humanly possible. 
4. Turn off WiFi as soon as you get to the home screen *through the Control Center by swiping up on the bottom of the screen*. The icon for WiFi in the Control Center should be *white*. By this point, you should still have the App Store.
5. Settings -> Wi-Fi -> the (i) next to your network (*be sure you are NOT connected to it*) -> Configure Proxy -> Automatic -> type "proxyblocker.github.io/proxy.pac" (without the quotes) -> Save
6. Turn back on WiFi in Control Center the same way you turned it off. The iPad will reconnect to your network. 
7. Enjoy! 

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** You must perform the same steps on *all other networks* you connect to, otherwise you will go back to a normal school iPad within about three seconds.
